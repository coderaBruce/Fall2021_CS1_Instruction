# Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation
## Pointers is a data type which stores address of anything
- Declare 
    - `p= int *a`
- Retrieve pointer's value:
    - `*p`
- Retrive variable's address:
    - `&a`
- Pointer reference:
    - `int* &b=a`

## Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Allocate Array
    - `int* arr = new int[size]`
- Deallocate array
    - `del[] arr`
